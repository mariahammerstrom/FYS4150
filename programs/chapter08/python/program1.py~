#
# This program solves Newtons equation for a block sliding on
# an horizontal frictionless surface.
# The block is tied to the wall with a spring, so N's eq takes the form:
#
#  m d^2x/dt^2 = - kx
#
# In order to make the solution dimless, we set k/m = 1.
# This results in two coupled diff. eq's that may be written as:
#
#  dx/dt = v
#  dv/dt = -x
#
# The user has to specify the initial velocity and position,
# and the number of steps. The time interval is fixed to
# t \in [0, 4\pi) (two periods)
